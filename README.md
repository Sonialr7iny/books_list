## 📖 How It Works
1. The app loads a predefined list of books (title + description,authors).  
2. Users can mark books as "favorite".  
3. The favorite state is stored locally with **SharedPreferences**, so it persists even after restarting the app.  
4. Theme (dark/light) is handled using Flutter’s `ThemeData`.
